This guide outlines the implementation steps for the described AWS architecture with CloudFront, WAF, ALB, ECS Fargate, and RDS PostgreSQL in a multi-AZ setup.

Phase 1: Network Infrastructure Setup
1.1 VPC Creation
Log in to AWS Management Console and navigate to VPC service

Create a new VPC:

Name: prod-vpc

IPv4 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16

Tenancy: Default

1.2 Subnet Configuration
Create public subnets:

public-subnet-1a in AZ-1a (CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24)

public-subnet-1b in AZ-1b (CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24)

Create private subnets for application layer:

private-app-subnet-1a in AZ-1a (CIDR: 10.0.3.0/24)

private-app-subnet-1b in AZ-1b (CIDR: 10.0.4.0/24)

Create private subnets for data layer:

private-data-subnet-1a in AZ-1a (CIDR: 10.0.5.0/24)

private-data-subnet-1b in AZ-1b (CIDR: 10.0.6.0/24)

1.3 Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway
Create and attach an Internet Gateway to the VPC

Create NAT Gateways in public subnets (one per AZ)

Allocate Elastic IPs for NAT Gateways

1.4 Route Tables
Create public route table:

Associate with public subnets

Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway

Create private route tables for app layer:

Associate with private app subnets

Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → NAT Gateway in respective AZ

Create private route tables for data layer:

Associate with private data subnets

No internet access (only local VPC routes)

Phase 2: Security Setup
2.1 Security Groups
Create ALB Security Group:

Allow HTTP/HTTPS from CloudFront IP ranges

Create ECS Security Group:

Allow traffic from ALB Security Group on app ports

Create RDS Security Group:

Allow traffic from ECS Security Group on PostgreSQL port (5432)

Create ElastiCache Security Group:

Allow traffic from ECS Security Group on Redis port (6379)

2.2 AWS Shield & WAF
Enable AWS Shield Advanced (if needed for DDoS protection)

Create WAF Web ACL:

Add AWS Managed Rules (e.g., Core Rule Set, Known Bad Inputs)

Configure rate limiting rules

Set up geographic restrictions if needed

Associate WAF with CloudFront distribution (will be done later)

Phase 3: Database Layer Setup
3.1 RDS PostgreSQL
Navigate to RDS service

Create PostgreSQL database:

Engine: PostgreSQL (latest stable version)

Template: Production

DB instance identifier: prod-db

Credentials: Set master username/password

DB instance class: Based on workload (e.g., db.m5.large)

Storage: Provisioned IOPS SSD with appropriate size

Availability: Multi-AZ deployment

VPC: Select your VPC

Subnet group: Create new group with private data subnets

Security group: RDS Security Group created earlier

Authentication: Password authentication

Enable automatic backups with appropriate retention period

3.2 ElastiCache Redis
Navigate to ElastiCache service

Create Redis cluster:

Cluster mode disabled (unless you need sharding)

Name: prod-redis

Engine version: Latest stable

Node type: Based on workload (e.g., cache.m5.large)

Number of replicas: 1 (for high availability)

Subnet group: Create new group with private data subnets

Security group: ElastiCache Security Group created earlier

Phase 4: Application Layer Setup
4.1 ECR Repositories
Navigate to ECR service

Create repositories for each microservice/container:

Name: prod-app

Configure image scan on push

4.2 ECS Cluster & Task Definitions
Navigate to ECS service

Create ECS cluster:

Name: prod-cluster

Infrastructure: AWS Fargate

Create Task Definitions:

Task definition name: prod-app-task

Task role: Create new IAM role with necessary permissions

Network mode: awsvpc

Container definitions:

Image: Reference your ECR repository

Port mappings: Map container port to host port

Environment variables: Database connection strings, Redis endpoint, etc.

Resource limits: Set CPU/memory based on requirements

4.3 ECS Services
Create ECS services in each AZ:

Service name: prod-app-service

Cluster: prod-cluster

Launch type: Fargate

Task definition: prod-app-task

Number of tasks: Start with 2 (scale as needed)

Deployment type: Rolling update

VPC: Your VPC

Subnets: Private app subnets

Security groups: ECS Security Group

Load balancer: Associate with ALB (will be created next)

Phase 5: Load Balancing & Content Delivery
5.1 Application Load Balancer
Navigate to EC2 > Load Balancers

Create Application Load Balancer:

Name: prod-alb

Scheme: Internet-facing

IP address type: IPv4

Listeners: HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)

VPC: Your VPC

Subnets: Select both public subnets

Security groups: ALB Security Group

Configure target groups:

Name: prod-app-tg

Target type: IP (for Fargate)

Protocol: HTTP

Port: Your application port

Health check path: /health

Configure HTTPS:

Request ACM certificate for your domain

Attach certificate to ALB listener

5.2 CloudFront Distribution
Navigate to CloudFront service

Create distribution:

Origin: Your ALB (as custom origin)

Origin protocol policy: HTTPS only

Viewer protocol policy: Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

Alternate domain names: Your domain name(s)

SSL certificate: Request or import ACM certificate

Default cache behavior:

Cache based on selected request headers

Forward cookies: All

Query strings: All

Enable WAF: Select the WAF Web ACL created earlier

Enable logging to S3

Phase 6: DNS & Final Configuration
6.1 Route 53 Configuration
Navigate to Route 53 service

Create record sets:

A record alias pointing to CloudFront distribution

CNAME for www version if needed

6.2 Monitoring & Logging
Set up CloudWatch Alarms for:

ALB request counts

ECS service CPU/memory utilization

RDS CPU utilization/connection counts

Enable CloudFront access logs to S3

Set up ALB access logs

Phase 7: Deployment & Testing
7.1 Initial Deployment
Push container images to ECR

Update ECS services with new task definitions

Monitor deployment in ECS console

7.2 Testing
Verify end-to-end connectivity:

CloudFront → ALB → ECS → RDS/Redis

Test failover scenarios:

Simulate AZ failure

Verify RDS failover

Load test application

Verify WAF rules are working

Phase 8: Automation & CI/CD (Optional)
Set up CodePipeline for automated deployments:

Source: CodeCommit/GitHub

Build: CodeBuild to build Docker images

Deploy: CodeDeploy to ECS

Configure infrastructure as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)

Set up automated scaling policies for ECS services

This implementation provides a highly available, secure architecture with proper separation of concerns between layers. Adjust the specific configurations (instance types, scaling parameters, etc.) based on your actual workload requirements.
